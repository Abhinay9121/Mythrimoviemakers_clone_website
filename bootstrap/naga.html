                <h5>STORTY</h5>
                </p>
                <p>A bus meets with an accident with 21 passengers. Vikram, was the only one that survived the accident.
                    Vikram
                    has vanishing twin syndrome, which makes Aditya, Vikram's invisible twin brother, control his left
                    hand.
                    A few days after the accident, Vikram is shown to be an advertisement director with his assistant
                    Kittu.
                    The latter gets a client named Chitra. He reveals that Chitra was his love when they were in
                    college. He
                    makes an ad that shows everything from the 80s to the 90s. The ad becomes a hit, and an ad company
                    asks
                    Vikram to take the ad in America. The latter takes the shot in America with Kittu as the director.
                    Vikram then reconciles with Chitra.

                    When Vikram comes back from America, he learns that his house exploded because of a bombed gas
                    cylinder.
                    He learns that his brother-in-law and his beloved niece Maha, died from that accident. Vikram gets
                    overwhelmingly devastated but then learns that Maha is still alive and tries to find her. He learns
                    that
                    someone kidnapped Maha. With anger, Aditya kills all the men sent by the kidnapper and swears to
                    find
                    him. He tries to get help from a police officer, but gets nothing.

                    When he goes to a DNA doctor, he learns that the same day when he admits his pregnant wife to the
                    hospital, the kidnapper sounded like a villager and kidnaps his wife. In order to save his wife, he
                    signs the file in his hand. The next day, Vikram gets a death certificate of the DNA doctor. In
                    order to
                    find out who the kidnapper is, the kidnapper makes Vikram run to all the destinations while he
                    chants
                    devotional chants. While he was running, Vikram drinks water from a local train but later learns
                    that
                    the bottle was sedated, and he starts to sleep. When he is close to finding who the kidnapper is, he
                    falls asleep. Chitra picks him up later on.

                    Vikram still recalls all the destinations he ran to and then learns that his name starts with A. To
                    find
                    out his connection with him, he searches for everything but learns that the chants he was chanting
                    were
                    marriage chants. He learns that he is Arun Raj Varma, his sister's almost-married husband. Vikram
                    goes
                    to his father to learn why he is like that. He learned that he had a bad life before and not
                    marrying
                    Siri, his sister, made him hungry for vengeance. Vikram investigates the places were he saw the
                    unconscious boy, and the back window was full of dust. He dusts the window and sees the number 21.

                    Vikram then gets beaten up by a gang sent by Arun, but Aditya saves him. He goes to Arun's hideout,
                    and
                    Vikram and Arun engaged in fight, where Vikram sees Maha is in danger, she was going to fall on
                    machine.
                    Vikram tries to save her, but Arun hits him with statue. Vikram gets conscious and Aditya fractures
                    Arun's hand and beats him and throws him on TV. Vikram catches falling Maha, and saves her from
                    falling.
                    Arun, still injured throws anchor on Vikram, but Aditya catches and throw back that anchor on Arun,
                    killing him. Before dying, Vikram tells him that the person who creates change is good person, but
                    person who destroys humanity is an evil.

                    In the end, Vikram praises Aditya for saving him, but then Aditya touches a stranger, and Vikram
                    apologizes. He pleads Chitra to tell her about the syndrome, but she gets mad at him and leaves him.
                    Vikram then gets mad at Aditya.</p>
