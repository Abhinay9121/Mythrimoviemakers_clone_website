                <h5>STORTY</h5>
                </p>
                <p>Vijay Krishna is an engineering graduate who is called a loser because of his bad luck and lack of
                    social
                    skills. He is often misunderstood and rejected by everybody except for his father Narayana, who
                    supports
                    him in every situation. He is, however an intelligent graduate who has an idea for an app to help
                    people
                    in road accidents and is looking for investors. He is in a relationship with Lahari, but he lies to
                    her
                    that he does not drink. Whenever he goes to the bar, he often drinks with his friend Mike, who is a
                    writer. They call themselves "Glassmates". He also never mentions that he works at a TV repair shop
                    part-time and only mentions that he is working on a project. Vijay pitches his idea but is insulted
                    by
                    Janardhan, an executive in a company who calls him unfit to complete his project because people do
                    not
                    care about rules. Vijay challenges Janardhan in front of his staff arrogantly and confidently.
                    Lahari
                    finds out the truth with the help of her friend Swecha, who is very hostile towards men and also
                    listens
                    to Vijay's pitch, and breaks up with Vijay. Swecha, however, gives Vijay a chance and takes him to
                    Mumbai where he completes the project. While they are in Mumbai, they stay in one of the employee's
                    houses, Kishore, who calls Swecha "sister" because he thinks Swetha has a negative attitude towards
                    men.
                    When they were done with the project plan and executing the plan, Janardhan makes the plan fail
                    again.
                    This makes Vijay angry, and he thinks he is fit for nothing. Before he leaves Mumbai, he finds out
                    that
                    Lahari and Swecha are friends and tells Lahari it was not her decision to break up with him. In
                    order to
                    complete the project, Vijay plans and executes an accident to prove his device's capability. After
                    the
                    accident, he is brought to court, where he is accused of being reckless and irresponsible in order
                    to
                    bring the app to public attention. The public prosecutor gives him a hard time with a barrage of
                    allegations. During the interval, Lahari expresses her unconditional love for him. Once the session
                    resumes again, he is given the right to pursue his dream by the judge.</p>
