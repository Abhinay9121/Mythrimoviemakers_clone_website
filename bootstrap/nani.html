                </p>
                <p>Six individuals successfully completed a bank robbery worth ₹300 crore (US$38 million) after which
                    one
                    robber kills the rest of the five and escapes with the money. Five bereaved women - Saraswati, who
                    lost
                    her grandson; Varalakshmi, who lost her son; Priya, who lost her fiancé Avinash; Swati, who lost her
                    elder brother; and Srinidhi (Chinnu), who became mute due to the shock of losing her father. They
                    are
                    brought together by Saraswati to avenge their loved ones. Pencil Parthasarathy, a small time crime
                    novelist who watches American movies and rewrites their plots into local Telugu novels, is
                    approached by
                    the five women in hope of tracking down the culprit. Pencil initially refuses, but sensing a good
                    and
                    probably first original story agrees to help them. The ragtag group, who eventually name themselves
                    as
                    Revengers, narrow down on a main suspect: Dev.

                    Dev is an ambulance driver turned F1 racer, who is now the new sensation in India. In order to buy a
                    sports bike, Dev killed his father and gained insurance. He also took up his father's job as an
                    ambulance driver. One day, in the hospital, he joined a group of five cancer patients planning a
                    robbery
                    to save money for their loved ones before they die. Afterwards, he kills the five and steal the
                    money
                    and followed his passion of becoming a successful race driver. The Revengers plot against him to
                    bring
                    him to justice. They discretely follow him and finds the stashed money in the constructed building
                    (where the five and Dev had practiced for the robbery). Dev learns that there is a gang behind him
                    and
                    also stole the money, He deduce Pencil's identity and also tips off the cops about the robbery and
                    also
                    Pencil's details in it.

                    Pencil successfully transfers the money before the police raid his place. However to his shock, he
                    deduced that the money was stolen by Saraswati, who reveals that her husband, who was working at a
                    book
                    store near the bank was killed by Dev on the night of the robbery. She convinced the gang into
                    believing
                    her grandson died to make her vengeance justified. She stole the money from Pencil's place and
                    donated
                    it for orphanage development and tells Pencil about her decision of abandoning the vengeance, after
                    Chinnu's injury during one of the chases. Pencil kills Dev at the latter's garage to protect his
                    newfound family, and frames it as a car accident. When he returns home, to his surprise, the gang
                    decides to give up on the plan of killing Dev for their revenge. Priya decides to move on from her
                    fiancé and when she learns that Pencil killed Dev, decides not to reveal it. Priya and Pencil get
                    married where Pencil successfully publishes Gang Leader, encapsulating his experiences. Also Chinnu
                    starts to speak when she sees the news about Dev's death. Sukumar meets Pencil for the copyrights to
                    make a movie based on his novel. It is also revealed that Pencil's dog was run over by Dev during
                    the
                    night of the robbery.</p>
