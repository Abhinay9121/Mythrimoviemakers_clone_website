                    <h5>STORTY</h5>
                    </p>
                    <p>Harsha Vardhan is the sole heir of his father Ravikanth's business empire worth ₹25,000 crore. After he
                        meets Charuseela at his friend Apparao's birthday party, he enrolls in a university course on rural
                        development. Charuseela wants to use technology for the benefit of Devarakota, a remote village in
                        Uttarandhra from which she hails. A friendship blossoms between them, and as time passes they become
                        attracted to each other. The natural resources of Devarakota are being exploited by Sashi, the brother
                        of Central minister Venkata Ratnam, whose tyranny has made many locals migrate to the city to seek a
                        better life. Nevertheless, the village head Narayana Rao hopes that the standard of living will soon
                        improve along with the general condition of the village. Meanwhile, Ratnam's son Radha uses blackmail to
                        threaten harm to Ravikanth's family if he does not back out of a prestigious highway contract.
                        Ravikanth's nephew Karthik, who hopes to succeed Ravikanth in the business empire, leaks to Radha
                        details about an upcoming bid for the contract, which comes to the notice of Harsha. After subtly
                        warning Ratnam at his residence in Delhi, Harsha secretly makes a lower bid on behalf of his father's
                        company and wins the contract.
        
                        When Charuseela learns that Harsha is Ravikanth's son, she starts avoiding him. When he asks the reason,
                        she says that Ravikanth is a native of Devarakota who left for Hyderabad to earn wealth unlike her
                        father Narayana Rao, and she bids farewell. After asking his father for a long holiday before joining
                        the office, Harsha travels to Devarakota without his father's knowledge. In Devarakota he meets Rao and
                        introduces himself as a student pursuing a course in rural development who has come to study the
                        village. After learning more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt
                        the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also
                        to develop the village, partly to win in the upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his
                        intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha learns from Rao that, as a young man,
                        Ravikanth wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the
                        local welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing many deaths and
                        Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, Insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the
                        city, and went on to acquire much wealth.
        
                        Charuseela returns to Devarakota and assumes that Harsha is trying to impress her family with the
                        intention of marrying her. Initially livid, Charuseela is impressed when Harsha succeeds in persuading
                        her uncle's family not to migrate to the city to live with their employed son and instead makes their
                        son agree to visit them every possible weekend. Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going
                        to take over all the agricultural land around the village for political gain since the value of the land
                        will appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor. Harsha
                        confronts them and warns them not to interfere in his work of developing the village. Harsha later
                        visits a water bottling unit which not only produces alcoholic beverages but also draws from the
                        village's source of drinking water. He tries to close it, but is attacked by Sashi's henchmen and is
                        hospitalised. Ravikanth, who has been informed of Harsha's adoption of Devarakota, manages to bring
                        Harsha back to Hyderabad, where he joins the office after he recovers. Ravikanth later confronts a
                        visibly upset Harsha and decides to send him back to Devarakota, earning Harsha's love for which he has
                        long yearned. Harsha hands over the reigns of the business empire to Karthik and leaves. At Devarakota,
                        Harsha kills Ratnam and Sashi at the factory and construes it as an accident due to an inadvertent short
                        circuit, similar to what Sashi had done before Ravikanth's arrest years before. The film ends with
                        Ravikanth and his family visiting Rao's house on Sankranthi, where Harsha, now Charuseela's husband,
                        receives them warmly.</p>
