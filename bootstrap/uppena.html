                    <h5>STORTY</h5>
                    </p>
                    <p>Set in 2002 in the village of Uppada near Kakinada, Raayanam is an influential zamindar who goes to any
                        extent to safeguard his family's honour. His daughter Sangeetha, fondly called Bebamma is a college
                        student whom he fiercely protects. Raayanam plans to build a shipping yard in his village by razing
                        fishermen's houses on the coast. Aasi is the son of one such fisherman Jalayya, and is a Dalit
                        Christian. He falls head over heels for Bebamma. Bebamma also begins to like Aasi after watching him
                        fight in the bazaar. Aasi follows Bebamma daily en route to her college on the bus. One day, the bus
                        breaks down and the driver asks Aasi to drop Bebamma, the only passenger of the bus, at college. Later,
                        the couple begins to meet daily at the beach and soon fall in love with each other.
        
                        Meanwhile, the breeding season of the fish arrives and no one is allowed to venture into the sea for
                        over a month and a half. Bebamma, however, asks Aasi to take her into the sea, which he obliges. As the
                        boat runs out of fuel, they get stuck in the sea.Then they have sex on the boat. On the same night,
                        Raayanam orders to raze the houses on the coast but he is worried that his daughter hasn't returned
                        home. Raayanam secretly meets Jalayya and asks him to find his missing daughter, in exchange, his house
                        will be spared. Aasi and Bebamma spend the night together on the boat intimately. Jalayya finds them the
                        next morning and admonishes Aasi. He returns Bebamma to her father but lies that she was found alone on
                        the boat.
        
                        Raayanam, however, is determined to find Bebamma's partner. He finds a shirt in Bebamma's wardrobe by
                        which he tracks him down as Aasi. Raayanam's men attack Aasi and his father at the village mela, and
                        Jalayya dies in strife. The following day, Bebamma runs away from her house and asks Aasi to elope with
                        her. He reluctantly agrees, and they board a train to Odisha escaping Raayanam's men. From there, the
                        couple travels to Kolkata, and later to Gangtok. Aasi picks up odd jobs and keeps Bebamma in a hostel
                        until they move in together.
        
                        Several months pass by. Raayanam has promised his sister that her son shall be married to Bebamma within
                        six months. All the days when Bebamma is away, Raayanam and his men pretend as if she was there to save
                        his family's honour. Nearly six months after they elope, Aasi promises to marry Bebamma and takes her to
                        a railway station. There, Raayanam's men kidnap Bebamma and bring her back to her father. Bebamma
                        confesses to Raayanam that she had sex with Kasi that night on the boat and pleads to let her go. But
                        Raayanam doesn't budge saying he would never let his daughter marry a lower caste, which he considers a
                        dishonour. He says it was Aasi who disclosed their location to him. Raayanam also reveals that he
                        physically emasculated Aasi by chopping his penis off and his father dying of a heart stroke by seeing
                        that the night before Bebamma and Aasi eloped. Raayanam believes she would not go back to Aasi because
                        he has lost his manhood. However, Bebamma loves Aasi as a person, regardless of what he did to him. She
                        says neither Raayanam nor Aasi is the one who can judge the manhood of a person. Bebamma adds that
                        manhood is not related to any organ but to a man's personality. Raayanam is moved and lets her go.
                        Bebamma and Aasi reunite.</p>
