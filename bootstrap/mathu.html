                </p>
                <p>Babu and Yesu are delivery men and friends living with their friend Abhi, who is unemployed and
                    binge-watches crime TV shows. With Babu struggling to make ends meet, Yesu reveals how he slyly
                    steals
                    from his clients and suggests Babu do the same. Although Babu is hesitant initially, he decides to
                    pursue the strategy. The next day, he goes to an isolated gated apartment complex. He has a few
                    abnormal
                    chance encounters: Tejaswi, who runs into him with a scooter; Banerjee, a police constable as part
                    of
                    passport verification; and a resident named Ravi. He reaches apartment 401, delivers a package to an
                    old
                    lady, steals one ₹500 note and attempts to get her to believe she underpaid him. When she realizes
                    his
                    bluff, a scuffle ensues and the old lady falls to the ground. After noticing her lifeless, Babu
                    imagines
                    Yesu and Abhi advising him about how to handle the situation and trying to cover up the crime. He
                    takes
                    her body to her room to make it look like she died in her sleep. He then notices Bujji, who has been
                    home all along with music playing through her headphones.

                    A security guard enters the apartment, prompting Babu to hide in a closet in the bathroom. Babu
                    witnesses the security guard enter the bathroom, under the rouse of fixing the shower, and replacing
                    the
                    memory card in a spy camera he had installed previously. Babu takes the camera and messages Yesu and
                    Abhi seeking help. Meanwhile, Bujji invites Ravi into the apartment to smoke marijuana. It is then
                    revealed that Bujji also drugged the old lady and inadvertently drugs Babu as well. Soon, Babu ends
                    up
                    asleep in Bujji's bedroom. Upon waking up, Babu finds himself in the living room next to a dead
                    body.
                    Horrified, he escapes and finds Yesu downstairs, and goes home. In his bag, Babu notices his
                    delivery
                    packages are missing and instead finds ₹50 lakh (US$63,000). He also finds Banerjee's mobile phone,
                    helping him realise that the dead body was Banerjee's. With Yesu and Abhi's help, Babu plans to
                    escape
                    by retrieving his bike and packages and deleting the video footage from the security cameras. Upon
                    reaching 401, he finds the old lady alive, and that the girl he met the previous day was not
                    Tejaswi.

                    He also realises that he woke up in apartment 501 and not 401. Upon entering 501, they find
                    Banerjee's
                    dead body. After retrieving the packages, they find the girl unconscious in a hidden drug lab in the
                    apartment. Babu realises that 501 is Ravi's flat and soon they find Ravi's dead body as well. By
                    threatening the watchman, he retrieves the spy camera from 401. The girl wakes up and engages in a
                    minor
                    scuffle, they interrogate her. She reveals herself as Myra, a drug dealer, came to pack drugs from
                    Ravi,
                    who cooks and supplies drugs. When Myra was waiting in 501 the previous morning, Banerjee came to
                    Ravi's
                    apartment for details about a neighbour. But instead, Banerjee learns about the drug lab. While Ravi
                    was
                    negotiating a bribe, Myra, under influence, kills Banerjee. Babu then reveals that Abhi was the
                    mastermind after seeing him in the camera footage earlier, and beats him up. Abhi explains that he
                    cooked the drugs and Ravi supplied them.

                    Upon finding Banerjee's dead body, Abhi hatched an escape plan and knocks out Myra and kills Ravi.
                    With
                    Babu contacting him from 401 seeking help, he planned to frame Babu by leaving him in the middle of
                    a
                    staged crime scene. Enraged, Babu destroys the lab causing an explosion of drugs and getting
                    everyone
                    high. Weeks later, Babu and Yesu wake up and find out from the interrogating detective that both
                    Abhi
                    and Myra are now mentally unstable. In exchange for the money, the detective lets them go scot-free.
                    In
                    the pre-roll credits, the Prime Minister of India declares all current ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes
                    illegal making the detective's newfound money completely useless.
