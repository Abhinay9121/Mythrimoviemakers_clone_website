                <h5>STORTY</h5>
                </p>
                <p>In 1980s, Chittibabu, a grumpy resident of Rangasthalam with partial deafness, irrigates agricultural
                    fields with an electric motor of Kolli Rangamma, his close confidant. Phanindra Bhupathi, President
                    of
                    Rangasthalam's Panchayat, is dreaded and treated with high regard. The village's Cooperative society
                    alias the society seizes maize crops of Erra Srinu in response to his delay in repaying the loan
                    despite
                    the family's contrasting claims. Stressed, he apparently drowns himself in the river to death.
                    Chittibabu gladly receives his elder brother Kumar Babu, who has gone for employment to Persian Gulf
                    a
                    long time ago. Chittbabu often escorts his brother to Rajahmundry for Kumar Babu to meet his love
                    interest Padma. Chittibabu encounters Ramalakshmi and passionately falls in love with her while
                    concealing his secret of being hard of hearing. Kumar Babu is disdained by the society's deeds of
                    charging high-interests on loans and annexing their properties under pretext of unpaid loans, taking
                    advantage of the villagers' illiteracy.

                    Chittibabu conflicts with Kashi's brothers for misbehaving with Ramalakshmi, who proposes marriage;
                    he
                    pretends to hear and leaves immediately. Later, Chittibabu realizes that she popped the question and
                    sneaks into her home at midnight but ends up alerting her family of his existence in the house due
                    to
                    his impairment. Lacking courage to admit her feelings for him, Ramalakshmi denies loving Chittibabu
                    to
                    the family and villagers, prompting everyone to misinterpret his intentions and Chittibabu to break
                    ties
                    with her. Eventually, after he protects a villager from committing suicide, Ramalakshmi discerns his
                    disability and offers to reconcile but he doesn't relent. Educated enough to grasp the society's
                    deception in her father's case too, Ramalakshmi protests with Kumar Babu, who inadvertently assaults
                    one
                    of the employees and a Panchayat is summoned to look into it. Intimidated to lie, Ramalakshmi's
                    father
                    drags her away and Bhupathi charges Kumar Babu a massive fine. Sheshu Naidu, the society's
                    president,
                    humiliates Koteswara Rao, Chittibabu and Kumar Babu's father but everyone chooses to repress it from
                    Chittibabu. Discovering it nevertheless, an outraged Chittibabu smacks Naidu and is consequently
                    apprehended by the Police, not before he reconciles with Ramalakshmi. As Bhupathi refuses to help,
                    Kumar
                    Babu consults Dakshina Murthy, the MLA of their constituency, nominates himself as Rangasthalam's
                    President candidate and plans to contest in the Panchayat elections against Bhupathi, who has been
                    winning unanimously for thirty years, unopposed every election.

                    Kumar Babu uncovers the society's fraudulent deeds, exposing it to the villagers, manages to acquire
                    their support and persuades them to nominate themselves as the ward members (Kashi and his brothers
                    inclusive) but Rangamma mysteriously denies support, upsetting Chittibabu. Upon being mocked and
                    confronted, Rangamma furiously discloses to him that several villagers, including her husband
                    Ramprasad
                    and Erra Srinu, were brutally murdered for attempting to oppose Bhupathi and that she is
                    apprehensive of
                    the same fate for Kumar Babu. Concerned for his brother, Chittibabu accepts a bribe from Bhupathi,
                    intending to eject the villagers' support for Kumar Babu but as the latter contemplates suicide, he
                    repents and returns the bribe, intimidating Bhupathi. Erra Srinu's father, who is a loyal servant to
                    Bhupathi despite his family being exploited by the Society, realizes that his son was murdered by
                    him,
                    having eavesdropped on the latter's conversation with Sheshu Naidu, who is violently struck and
                    killed
                    with a pot by an insane Bhupathi after advising him to step down before he loses the election. While
                    returning home alone after his meeting with Padma, Kumar Babu is ruthlessly hacked by Bhupathi’s men
                    while Chittibabu uncovers the conspiracy and rushes to protect him. Chittibabu subdues the assassins
                    and
                    takes Kumar Babu, who has sustained himself and a few wounds, to a roadside shop and goes to procure
                    first-aid but returns to find that a veiled man has absconded after slitting Kumar Babu's throat.
                    Before
                    dying, he tries to name the perpetrator but Chittibabu fails to hear it. Dejected by his demise, the
                    villagers led by Chittibabu barge into Bhupathi's house but comprehend that he has decamped. Chitti
                    Babu, now with a hearing aid, along with a gang of men including Kashi, hunts far and wide for
                    Bhupathi
                    following the directions of a soothsayer, while broken internally as a result of Kumar Babu’s death.
                    After Kumar Babu's cremation, Rangamma is unanimously elected as Rangasthalam's President of
                    Panchayat
                    and she assumes authority. Chitti Babu sees dancers chanting the name of "Srimannarayana"; deducing
                    that
                    his brother was trying to say the same before his death, Chittibabu races to meet Dakshina Murthy
                    but
                    witnesses him being hit by a truck and hospitalizes him (the opening scene).

                    He tends to a comatose Dakshina Murthy for 2 whole years, volunteering to care for him despite
                    doctors
                    and family giving up on Murthy’s chances of survival, and lives at the hospital taking care of
                    Murthy’s
                    every need. One day he finally recuperates and after he has fully convalesced 2 months later, Chitti
                    Babu goes to meet him at his residence, where celebrations are aroar regarding Murthy’s upcoming
                    minister position. Upon being inquired about Bhupathi, Chittibabu confesses to murdering him after
                    locating him but divulges that Kumar Babu's culprit was someone else: Dakshina Murthy himself, who
                    instructed his henchman Srimannarayana to kill Kumar Babu, detesting his love affair with his
                    youngest
                    daughter Padma. Dakshina Murthy eventually admits that Chittibabu's accusation is true and expresses
                    his
                    contempt for the relationship as Kumar Babu belonged to a lower caste, viciously splashing his water
                    into Chitti Babu’s face as a symbol of inferiority. Ultimately, Chittibabu reveals that he has
                    spared
                    him all these days to murder him when he has aspirations to survive, quietly eliminates him in his
                    men's
                    absence and leaves his house with Ramalakshmi, his wife, while they spot Padma and her husband
                    approaching.</p>
