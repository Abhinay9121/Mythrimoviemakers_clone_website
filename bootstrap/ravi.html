                <p>Set in New York, the film revolves around Amar, who once freed from the prison, kills a businessman
                    before extracting from him a "Fido" ring. However, Amar is unaware of the fact that he has multiple
                    personality disorder that causes him to assume two more identities in addition to his own. Each
                    identity
                    has a trigger that results in its emergence. Whenever something breaks, he transforms into Akbar, a
                    muslim man who keeps helping the needy. Whenever he sees someone acting abnormally, he transforms
                    into
                    Mark Anthony, a calm doctor. Whenever something explodes, he becomes Amar himself. While as Akbar,
                    he
                    meets Pooja, a young woman who also has MPD. In a gym, a few men try to flirt with her and them
                    telling
                    her to "trust them" triggers the alternate personality which violently beats them up. Pooja is
                    surprised
                    to meet Akbar as Dr. Anthony who soon starts her therapy.

                    In the meanwhile, FBI officer Balwant Kharge investigates the murder of the first businessman and
                    being
                    a partner, he keeps informing the remaining three businessmen who might be the next targets.
                    Evidences
                    bring him closer to the realization that Amar might be involved in the murder. Pooja's uncle Jalal
                    Akbar
                    unites with her. Her real name is revealed to be Aishwarya. With time, Amar ends up realizing that
                    something is wrong with him. He visits the grave of his parents with flowers but is chased by Kharge
                    and
                    his fellow officers. He tries to kill the next target but somehow fails. He hires Bobby, a random
                    stranger, to find out what's wrong with him. He realizes that he has MPD, while the flashback is
                    revealed in the words of Jalal Akbar to Aishwarya and Dr. Mark Anthony's words to Kharge. It is
                    revealed
                    that Amar and Aishwarya's families were betrayed by four businessmen whom they trust and awarded
                    "Fido"
                    rings. The explosion of their house triggered the disorder in Amar and the menace created by the
                    businessmen triggered it in Aishwarya. The businessmen tried to kill Amar, Aishwarya and Jalal in a
                    subsequent chase but failed. Aishwarya and Amar were admitted to Dr. Anthony's school where they got
                    separated by circumstances.

                    Back in the present, Amar manages to kill the second businessman by strangulating him while also
                    leaving
                    behind clues that alert Kharge. However, this disorder causes Amar to miss Saboo Menon, the target
                    he
                    earlier failed to kill. He then manipulates the members of WATA, an association for Telugu people,
                    into
                    killing Menon. They're taken in and end up leading Kharge to the truth. Karan Arora, the fourth
                    businessman, calls Amar for a meeting in exchange for Jalal and Aishwarya's freedom. Realizing his
                    loved
                    ones are still alive, Amar arrives for the exchange and in the presence of Kharge and his assistant,
                    breaks into a fight that leaves the henchmen wounded and Arora dead. He extracts the last Fedo ring
                    and
                    then leaves the scene. Kharge is disappointed to realize he kidnapped someone else instead of
                    Aishwarya.
                    Amar then visits his long-left house where he unites with Aishwarya, with Dr. Anthony explaining to
                    Jalal that their mental condition will now start returning to normal. Kharge decides to testify
                    against
                    Amar but instead covers up for him after being blackmailed by a letter.</p>
