                <h5>STORTY</h5>
                </p>
                <p>Upon his brother Shiva's encouragement, Sathyam operates a large automobile service center named
                    "Janatha
                    Garage". One day, a poor man, and a friend of Sathyam, loses his college-going daughter in a road
                    accident. Sathyam and his allies learn that she was assaulted and killed by some goons. They ask
                    Shiva's
                    friend ASP Chandrashekar to help, but he's helpless as there is no proper evidence against the
                    goons,
                    who have an influential background. Sathyam takes justice into his own hands by killing the goons
                    and
                    making it look like an accident. Chandrashekar becomes aware and warns them against their actions,
                    as he
                    is worried about the consequences.

                    Janatha Garage became popular for those seeking justice for the underprivileged. Shiva marries and
                    has a
                    son Anand. One day Mukesh, a powerful and corrupt entrepreneur, visits and warns Sathyam to stop
                    interfering in his business. A few days later, Shiva and his wife are ambushed and killed by
                    Mukesh's
                    men. Chandrashekar asks Sathyam to give up his work for Anand's sake. Instead, Sathyam gives him to
                    Suresh, Anand's maternal uncle, so he will be safe.

                    As an adult, Anand is an environmental science graduate and activist in Mumbai, with the same
                    fighting
                    spirit as Sathyam, worrying Suresh. Anand and Suresh's daughter Bujji fall in love with each other,
                    delighting her parents. Anand meets Anu, a fellow student, and scolds her for using firecrackers
                    during
                    Diwali, but the two become friends. Anand gets into a fight with a powerful local MLA over
                    environmental
                    rights. Fearing for his safety, Suresh sends him away to Hyderabad under the pretext of a university
                    exchange program.

                    Sathyam is in an accident planned by Mukesh but recovers. As Sathyam was asked to limit stress, his
                    allies turn people away. Sathyam asks his son, Raghava, to take over, but he refuses. Raghava
                    marries
                    Mukesh's daughter, Riya, without his family's approval. Anand fights off Raghava's thugs to stop an
                    illegal mining site. Sathyam meets with Anand, not knowing they're related. Impressed by Anand,
                    Sathyam
                    asks him to take over the garage, and he agrees, becoming a part of the household and reviving
                    Janatha
                    Garage.

                    Chandrashekar, now the Commissioner of Police, tries to dissuade Anand from Janatha Garage but
                    fails. He
                    looks up Anand's family, and brings Suresh and his family to Sathyam's house, revealing Sathyam and
                    Anand's connection. Afraid for Bujji's safety, Suresh tells Anand to choose either Bujji or Janatha
                    Garage. Choosing his father's family, Anand and Bujji tearfully say goodbye, and she marries someone
                    else. Raghava and Riya leave Sathyam's house because of their uncultured lifestyle creating a ruckus
                    with Anand and the family. Anand reconnects with Anu, revealed to be Chandrashekar's daughter. Anu
                    tells
                    Anand that she's attracted to him, and they fall in love with each other.

                    Several bomb blasts occurred in Hyderabad. Bose, one of Sathyam's closest allies, loses his fiancée
                    in
                    the blasts. Soon after, Bose is found dead, with police believing he committed suicide. When the
                    police
                    chief tells Chandrashekar to close the bomb blast case, he asks Janatha Garage for help. Anand
                    tracks
                    down the goons responsible for the blast and, in the process, discovers Bose was killed by Raghava.
                    Bose
                    found out that Raghava and Mukesh planned the blasts to undermine Janatha Garage's government
                    influence.
                    Sathyam decides that even though Raghava is his son, he can't live. Janatha Garage finds Mukesh and
                    Raghava's hideout, beating up their men to get to them. Anand kills Mukesh; cornered, Raghava pleads
                    for
                    mercy, but Sathyam arrives and kills Raghava without remorse. The film ends with Sathyam and his
                    family
                    celebrating Diwali when Anand goes to help someone. Anu is also there, now Anand's wife, and tells
                    him
                    that no firecrackers will be set off as he leaves.</p>
