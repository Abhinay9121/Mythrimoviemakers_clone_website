                <h5>STORTY</h5>
                </p>
                <p>The movie revolves around Bobby, a leftist student union leader struggling with anger management
                    issues.
                    He fights with a local politician, Bulliah's brother, and causes a girl from his college to attempt
                    suicide due to repeated love torture. Bobby runs into Lilly, who causes him a minor accident while
                    returning from lock-up. He takes away her money to fix his bike and learns that Lilly was his
                    childhood
                    friend, the cousin of his neighbor's daughter Jaya.

                    During a cricket match, Bobby discovers Lilly is a state-level cricket player and falls in love with
                    her. However, Lilly tells Bobby to resolve conflicts internally rather than engage in fights. She
                    also
                    shares that she had a brother who lost his life in a college campus clash.

                    During Jaya's marriage, Bobby confesses his love for Lilly but is rejected by her. He rides to
                    Hyderabad
                    to meet her and expresses his feelings for her. Lilly agrees to rectify his excessive aggression,
                    but
                    Bobby is scared of his excessive aggression. Their love affair continues passionately until one
                    fateful
                    day, Bobby is drawn into a fight with Bulliah's brother's gang, leading to the death of Bulliah's
                    brother.

                    Lilly advises Bobby to give up his violent tendencies for the peace of mind of his loved ones. She
                    gives
                    him an ultimatum to choose between controlling his anger and continuing to be with her or leaving
                    her
                    forever. Bobby loses his temper at this demand and pushes Lilly out of the hospital, telling her to
                    get
                    lost in front of family and friends.

                    Bobby, a cricketer, realizes his mistake and tries to reach out to Lilly, who asks him not to
                    disturb
                    her anymore. He leaves home to find inner peace and joins a group working on a project on Sound
                    healing.
                    Three years later, Bobby and his team go to Hyderabad to meet a doctor to showcase their work. They
                    see
                    Jaya and her husband, who ask Bobby if he visited Lilly in the hospital. Bobby learns that Lilly had
                    an
                    accident during National Selection and is sad and agitated. He takes her on a road trip to Kerala to
                    heal her physically and emotionally.

                    Lilly returns to her house and meets the doctor who warns her of hidden pain inside. Bobby dismisses
                    this and gives her his Digital voice recorder to listen to if she feels pain. They are invited to
                    their
                    common friends' marriage, where Lilly is impressed by Bobby's newfound maturity. She asks Bobby to
                    marry
                    her, but Bobby states there is no urgency for their marriage and asks her to focus on her career
                    goals.

                    To his surprise, Lilly reveals that she has left cricket for good. Bobby starts to wonder why Lilly
                    has
                    suddenly lost all passion for cricket. One day, Bobby spots Lilly's former teammate and friend
                    Rubina,
                    who tells him the whole truth about Lilly's life after he left. Lilly's team won a high-profile
                    tournament and was named the "best player." Ramesh Rao, a south-zone selector for BCCI, lusts for
                    Lilly
                    and demands she sleep with him to get selected for the national team. Lilly refuses to lodge any
                    complaint due to fear of confrontation, but Rubina complains on her behalf. Ramesh Rao physically
                    assaults both Lilly and Rubina, leaving Lilly severely scarred mentally and slipping into
                    psychological
                    breakdown and depression.

                    Bobby, a former cricketer, becomes furious after learning about Ramesh Rao's sexual harassment
                    incident.
                    He breaks down in front of Lilly, apologizing for leaving her, and Lilly is heartened by the return
                    of
                    his old passion for her. Bobby takes Lilly to the police station where he lodges an official
                    complaint
                    against Rao. Lilly realizes that Bobby's emotional turnaround has led him to take punitive action
                    against Rao, but she refuses to cooperate with his plans.

                    Lilly decides to meet up with a groom her family has arranged for her, and Bobby tries to convince
                    her
                    not to run away from her life. However, Lilly blames him for not being around when she really needed
                    him
                    years ago and sees a future with the new groom. To Bobby's dismay, she tells him she would forget
                    him in
                    a few years, just like he had done to her.

                    Bobby leaves Lilly, flashing back to his life in Ladakh, where he had attempted to find peace in
                    life
                    but failed. Ignorant of all this, Lilly gets confirmation of her marriage to be scheduled within the
                    month and is consumed by the prospect of losing Bobby forever. She desperately reaches out for
                    Bobby's
                    old voice recorder, which contained his personal messages to her over their years of separation.

                    The video footage of Bobby assaulting Rao goes viral, making it a national issue. Lilly and her
                    family
                    are now thrust into the media's limelight, and the Board of Control for Cricket in India appoints a
                    four-member committee to investigate the allegations against Rao.

                    The police officer investigating a sexual assault case arrests Bobby, a friend of Ramesh Rao.
                    Despite
                    being threatened, Bobby refuses to let Ramesh off and coerces Lilly to lie in exchange for his
                    release.
                    Lilly's deposition before the BCCI committee reveals she was not sexually harassed by Ramesh, but
                    Bobby
                    is disillusioned and gives up the fight for justice. Ramesh Rao insults both Bobby and Lilly in
                    court,
                    demanding an apology for false allegations. Lilly, enraged, attacks Ramesh Rao and confesses to
                    sexually
                    harassing her, abusing his position as a selector. Bobby watches from the sidelines, seeing the
                    passionate cricketer return. Lilly urges Bobby to have a comrade who supports her journey and
                    instills
                    courage in her. They reunite, embracing their true selves, and Bobby drops Lilly at the National
                    Cricket
                    Academy.
