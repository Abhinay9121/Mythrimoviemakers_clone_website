                <h5>STORTY</h5>
                </p>
                <p>Set in the late 90s, labourer Pushpa Raj decides to smuggle red sandalwood with his friend Kesava. He
                    moves up the ranks in smuggler Konda Reddy's group while evading DSP Govindappa. Konda's brother
                    Jaali
                    hates Pushpa for getting more attention from his elder brother. Konda's boss, Srinu, entrusts Konda
                    to
                    keep his contraband of tonnes of sandalwood safe from the Police Department, and Pushpa is assigned
                    to
                    the task by the Reddy brothers, so that if anything happens to it, they can blame him in front of
                    Srinu.
                    Jaali intentionally sabotages Pushpa so he'll get caught by the police, but Pushpa and Kesava use
                    their
                    quick thinking to avoid getting caught. Pushpa finds out Srinu is scamming his workers and tells
                    Konda,
                    but he refuses to go up against the powerful Srinu.

                    Pushpa falls in love with Srivalli, a milk seller, and an engagement is arranged. During the
                    ceremony,
                    Pushpa's elder half-brother Mohan makes a scene, revealing Pushpa is illegitimate. In the ensuing
                    scuffle, Pushpa's mother gets hurt, which motivates him to make his way up. He bypasses Srinu, and
                    is
                    able to get a higher profit for the wood that he agrees to split with Konda. Jaali discovers
                    Srivalli's
                    father is a mole for Govindappa; lusting after Srivalli, Jaali blackmails her to sleep with him to
                    save
                    her father. Srival
                    li tells Pushpa, who beats Jaali and leaves him paralyzed. Jaali doesn't tell Konda
                    who beat him, wanting to kill Pushpa himself, but Konda discovers the truth on his own.

                    Konda attempts to kill Pushpa, but they're attacked by Srinu's men and brother-in-law, Mogileesu,
                    who
                    kills Konda Reddy. Pushpa rescues Konda's younger brother Jakka, rekindling their partnership, and
                    murders Mogileesu. MP Naidu arranges a truce between Pushpa and Srinu, but after discovering about
                    the
                    latter's scams, he appoints Pushpa to replace Srinu. As time goes by, Pushpa takes control of the
                    entire
                    syndicate.

                    Govindappa resigns, and Bhanwar Singh Shekawat takes charge. Pushpa offers a bribe to Shekawat, but
                    Shekawat ridicules Pushpa due to arrogance. After this incident, Pushpa ostensibly turns meek and
                    submissive towards Shekawat, but on the day of his marriage, Pushpa gets his revenge on Shekawat,
                    revealing that he promised his mother he would stay safe and not get into trouble before his wedding
                    day.

                    Pushpa forces Shekawat to strip semi-naked while he also does the same, boasting that he derives his
                    prestige and power from his own self, while Shekawat is nothing without his uniform and that without
                    it,
                    even his dog won't recognize him. Pushpa leaves to marry Srivalli, while a humiliated Shekawat walks
                    home, where his dog fails to identify him, just like how Pushpa predicted. Enraged, Shekawat shoots
                    and
                    kills his dog, whilst also burning Pushpa's bribe money, swearing revenge. Pushpa, after tying the
                    knot
                    to Srivalli, tells her that his "rule" has just begun.</p>
